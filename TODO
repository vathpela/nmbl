The basic implementation plan, as of 2018-09-16

- make shim have a LOADER_PROTOCOL
- alter systemd-boot
  - use shim's LOADER_PROTOCOL
    - make it so not using it is something you can build but it's just
      hard to do.
  - make sure it has a command line mode we can use
  - give it grubenv-style state storage
  - teach it about boot-once, boot-loop/failure detection, forced
    cmdline
  - make sure it doesn't fuck up flicker-free
  - audit the hell out of it :(
- make intiramfs with dracut --uefi
  - make sure "dracut --uefi" works right with signatures

- figure out what we need for ppc64le and Z

- write a first-stage loader for u-boot for BIOS,ppc64le,s390x
  - needs to have the ability to read and write from disks, where
    possible
- make a tool to install u-boot on non-efi
  armv7,ppc64le,s390x(?) 1st and 2nd stage and
  - "audit" all our UEFI tools for big endian in case we need it for s390x
- port initrd bits for boot-once, boot-loop/failure detection, forced
  cmdline, etc.
- profit
